# Leaderboard
A leaderboard is a way to track the performance of users or teams in a competitive environment. It is typically displayed as a table or list, with the users or teams ranked by their scores. Leaderboards can be used to motivate users to improve their performance, to provide a sense of accomplishment, and to create a sense of community.
